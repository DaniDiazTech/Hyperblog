				<h1>This is the title of our incredible interesting post</h1>
				<p>
					This is the paragraph in which we'll explain the awesome things we can do with git branches.
				</p>

				<p>
					Git branches are the way we can work on diferent features at the same time without affecting the 
					core structure of our Git repository
				</p>
				<p>
					For example if you have a web project, and you want to build a brand new header, you would create 
					a branch named "header", checkout to that branch build the necessary stuff, and finally merge all the changes with the main branch.
