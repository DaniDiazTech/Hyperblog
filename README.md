# Hyperblog

Simple HTML blog for the Git &amp; GitHub professional course.

Nothing interesting, but please take a look at some of [my projects](https://github.com/DaniDiazTech).

Again:
    - It stills a really simple project, so don't waste your time looking at the source code.
    - Seriously, it's just a simple HTML blog.
